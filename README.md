# Hands on Python Machine Learning - IAP at MIT 
The easisest option to get the course material is clonining this git repository.
To do so type git clone
In order to get all the material for the course I suggest cloning this git repository. To do so type git clone https://github.com/yaniyuval/ML_IAP.git. Alternatively, you can download a zip file.


All through the IAP, we will use Jupyter notebooks. If you are not familiar with Jupyter notebooks, please go over some basic tutorial (e.g., https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/) to be able to run it and run code on the notebook. I also added to the repository a tutorial notebook (taken from [Stephan's Rasp repository](https://github.com/raspstephan/MPI-ML-Tutorial/blob/master/jupyter-intro.ipynb)  If you have difficulties, please contact me. I also recommend havinng a look on the [fastai notebook tutorial](https://github.com/fastai/course-v3/blob/master/nbs/dl1/00_notebook_tutorial.ipynb).  

If you are not so familiar with Python and Python packages, I highly recommend using the Anaconda package manager. Simply go to the website and download the Anaconda version for your OS and follow the installation instructions. Then install the packages we will need for this tutorial:

conda install numpy matplotlib jupyter scikit-learn keras
Then go into this directory on your machine and type jupyter notebook. A window should appear in your browser. From there click on the demo.ipynb notebook and try to execute all cells. To execute a cell simply click the play button or type shift + Enter.
